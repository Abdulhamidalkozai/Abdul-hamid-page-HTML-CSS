     <div class="h1">What is Web-101</div>
        <p>Introduction: The growth of the WWW has been unprecedented!
         More than 6 million people are using the World Wide Web, less than five years after it was invented and there appears to be no end in sight.
         Have you ever wondered how it all happened; who dreamed up this unbelievable tool used by everyone from a grade school student to a college professor? How it all comes together and works? I did, especially after I was assigned to our Web development team in May of 1998.
         
         Shortly after joining the Web development team, I attended a presentation at a Sterling Software Conference entitled Web 101. Although I found the presentation very interesting, I still had all kinds of questions. So much of the information was over my head. What I needed was a basic introduction to the Web and how it worked. Since I could not find one, I did what almost everyone else was doing; I went on the Web and began exploring, looking for information about the Web. The more I learned, the more I wanted to know. In addition, I wanted to share what I had learned with my team members and co-workers. The result is this presentation, Web 101 for Dummies.
         
         How It all Began
         
         It all began in Geneva Switzerland at the CERN Laboratories, when Tim Berners-Lee, a graduate of Oxford University, got frustrated because his daily scheduler, his list of phone numbers, and his documents were stored in different databases on different machines making it impossible for him to access them all simultaneously. In 1980 he wrote a program entitled, "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which enabled him to access his private data across multiple machines and databases. Shortly after writing this program, he left CERN Laboratories to accept another position.
         
         In 1989, he returned to CERN Laboratories and discovered 2 things. 1) No one had done anything with his program and 2) data at the laboratories was even more distributed than before. Shortly after returning, he proposed the use of a hypertext-based system to access the data stored across multiple machines and databases. He believed that hypertext was the solution for providing "a single user-interface" to large classes of stored information such as reports, notes, databases, computer documentation, etc.
         
         Then in 1990, while working on a project to enable information sharing within internationally dispersed teams and the dissemination of information by support groups, he proposed a Web concept.
         
         The project was approved and development began. By November 1990, his development team began testing the following:
         
         the Web browser
         the Web server
         the protocol to communicate between the client and the server, HTTP
         the language used to compose the Web documents, HTML
         the means to locate the information, the URL
         By May of 1991, the first Web application was ready for use by the scientists at CERN Laboratories.</p>
